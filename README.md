# wtmcp

MCP server with a language-agnostic plugin system. Plugins are simple
executables (Python, bash, or any language) that communicate with the
core over JSON-lines on stdin/stdout. The core handles auth, HTTP
proxying, caching, and output encoding so plugins stay minimal.

## Features

- **Plugin protocol**: JSON-lines over stdin/stdout, any language
- **Auth**: Bearer, Basic, Kerberos/SPNEGO, OAuth2 with token refresh,
  auto-detection from available credentials
- **HTTP proxy**: Auth injection, domain validation, TLS enforcement,
  binary response encoding, multipart upload support
- **Cache**: In-memory store with namespace isolation and TTL
- **File I/O**: Atomic writes, path confinement, size limits, per-plugin
  output directories, source_path handoff for large files
- **Output**: TOON encoding for ~40% token savings (optional)
- **Credential management**: Secure credential storage using OS-native
  keyrings (Linux Secret Service, macOS Keychain) with migration from
  plaintext env.d files, encrypted OAuth tokens, and backup/restore.
  See [docs/credentials-guide.md](docs/credentials-guide.md)
- **Plugin setup**: Manifest-declared wizard metadata for CLI tooling
- **Progressive discovery**: Tools default to deferred; only primary
  tools are loaded into model context. Deferred tools are
  discoverable via `tool_search` and called directly through MCP
- **Agent profiles**: Per-connection tool filtering — different agents
  see different tool subsets based on their mTLS client-certificate
  identity (streamable-http) or a `--profile` flag (stdio). Fail-closed
  on streamable-http (stdio is fail-open without `--profile`). See
  [docs/profiles-guide.md](docs/profiles-guide.md)
- **Encrypted credentials**: Ansible Vault encrypted env.d files,
  auto-detected and decrypted transparently at startup

## Security

wtmcp enforces security at the core level so plugins don't need to
implement their own auth, input validation, or network restrictions.

### HTTP Proxy & SSRF Prevention

All plugin HTTP traffic goes through the core proxy. No plugin makes
direct network connections.

- **SSRF-safe dialer** validates resolved IPs at connection time —
  blocks private, loopback, link-local, multicast, and IPv6-mapped
  IPv4 addresses
- **Domain allowlisting** per plugin — only declared domains are
  reachable
- **Credential stripping on cross-domain redirects** — Authorization,
  Cookie, and API key headers are removed when redirected to a
  different host
- **Dangerous headers stripped** from plugin-crafted requests
  (Host, Proxy-Authorization, X-Forwarded-For, etc.)
- **HTTPS enforcement** for authenticated requests; mTLS support
  with certificate chain verification
- **Userinfo URL rejection** — `user:pass@host` URLs are blocked

### Sandboxing

OS-level plugin isolation via
[arapuca](https://github.com/LeGambiArt/arapuca) is built by
default:

- **Landlock LSM** filesystem confinement (Linux) — plugins can
  only read/write declared paths
- **Seatbelt** sandboxing (macOS) — equivalent confinement
- **cgroup v2** resource limits — memory, CPU, PIDs, file size
  (configurable per-plugin)
- **Network namespace isolation** — plugins cannot make direct
  connections; all traffic routes through the core proxy
- **OOM detection** and resource usage reporting after process exit

**Platform note**: Linux provides the strongest sandbox protection.
The file I/O path on Linux uses `O_NOFOLLOW` + `/proc/self/fd`
readlink to close TOCTOU gaps in source_path validation. On macOS,
the Seatbelt sandbox provides equivalent filesystem confinement but
the file I/O path uses a stat-then-open fallback with a narrower
(but non-zero) TOCTOU window. Production deployments should use
Linux.

Building requires libarapuca — either from a system package
(Fedora) or built from the bundled submodule (requires a
Rust toolchain). The Makefile auto-detects which path to use:

```bash
make build    # auto-detects system libarapuca or builds from submodule
```

To build **without** sandbox (debug/development only):

```bash
make nosandbox
WTMCP_UNSANDBOXED=1 ./wtmcp   # required at runtime
```

Binaries built without sandbox loudly warn at startup, in logs,
and in the MCP server description visible to the LLM.

### Rate Limiting

Token-bucket rate limiting with configurable per-plugin, per-domain,
and global limits. Defaults: 120 req/min per plugin, 600 req/min
global. Google Workspace APIs (Docs, Drive, Gmail) default
to 300 req/min per domain.

When the proxy's rate limiter would reject a request, it waits for
a token instead of returning an error — up to 2 retries with a 15s
per-wait cap. This applies to all HTTP methods (including POST)
because it is pre-flight token acquisition, not request replay.
The tool call timeout provides the hard outer bound.

```yaml
http:
  rate_limit:
    default: "120/m"
    global: "600/m"
    per_plugin:
      jira: "60/m"
    per_domain:
      api.github.com: "30/m"
```

### HTTP Retries

Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient upstream
failures. Only idempotent methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,
DELETE) are retried — POST/PATCH are never retried. Respects
`Retry-After` headers (clamped to 30s). Context-aware: the tool
call timeout naturally caps total retry duration.

```yaml
http:
  retries:
    max: 3                          # retries (not counting initial)
    backoff: exponential            # 1s, 2s, 4s... capped at 30s
    retry_on: [500, 502, 503, 504]  # status codes to retry
```

### Cache Limits

Per-plugin entry limits with LRU eviction. Entries exceeding
`max_entry_size` are rejected. Background cleanup removes expired
entries at the configured interval.

```yaml
cache:
  max_entries_per_plugin: 10000  # LRU eviction when exceeded
  max_entry_size: 1048576        # 1MB max per entry
  cleanup_interval: 60s          # expired entry sweep
```

### Audit Logging

Structured JSON audit log with UUIDv7 correlation IDs:

- Tool call events: plugin, tool, parameters (scrubbed), duration
- Elicitation events: plugin, tool, action (accept/decline/cancel/
  error/unsupported)
- HTTP proxy events: method, host, path, status, response size
- Credential scrubbing: field names (password, token, secret),
  JWT detection (`eyJ` prefix), high-entropy string detection
- Configurable output: file (0600 permissions) and/or stdout

```yaml
audit:
  log_file: logs/audit.log
  stdout: false
  scrub_fields: [password, token, secret, api_key, authorization]
```

### Prompt Injection Defense

- **MCP Elicitation** (enabled by default) prompts the user for
  confirmation before executing any write tool. The confirmation
  message shows the tool name and scrubbed parameters. Clients
  that lack elicitation support are blocked by default
  (`elicitation_strict: true`). Disable elicitation entirely with
  `security.elicitation: false`, or allow fallthrough for clients
  without elicitation support with `security.elicitation_strict: false`
- **Output framing** (enabled by default) with per-session
  cryptographic nonce — injected tags in plugin output are detected
  and escaped. Disable with `security.tag_tool_output: false`
- **MCP Audience annotation** set to `[assistant]` on all tool
  results (always active)
- **JSON Schema validation** on every tool call from compiled
  plugin YAML
- **Write tool convention**: included plugins default to
  `dry_run=true` in their schemas, requiring explicit opt-out.
  This is a plugin-level convention, not core-enforced
- **Read-only mode** enforced at three layers: tool registration,
  disabled stubs, and runtime rejection

```yaml
security:
  elicitation: true        # confirm before write tools (default: true)
  elicitation_strict: true # block writes if client lacks elicitation (default: true)
  tag_tool_output: true    # nonce-based output tagging (default: true)
```

### Credential Isolation

Plugin processes receive only the credentials they need.

- **Scoped env.d** — each plugin receives only its credential
  group's variables
- **Filtered environment** — allowlist of safe system vars passed
  to plugins (PATH, HOME, LANG, TZ, TMPDIR, XDG_* dirs, etc.)
- **File permission enforcement** — env.d files and directories
  require 0600/0700 (SSH-style)
- **Symlink rejection** on credential files, CA certs, and env.d
  entries
- **Vault password zeroing** — decryption keys cleared from memory
  after use (best-effort; Go's GC may retain copies)
- **Memory-backed secure files** — decrypted credentials stored
  via `memfd_create`, never touch disk

### Agent Profiles (per-connection tool filtering)

Restrict which tools an agent can discover and call, based on its
identity. Without profiles, every client sees every tool; with them, a
read-only review agent and a CI agent can share one wtmcp instance with
different tool subsets.

- **mTLS identity** — on streamable-http, agents are identified by their
  verified TLS client certificate (CN or SAN). `client_auth: require` is
  mandatory whenever profiles are configured.
- **Stdio** — a single agent selects its profile with `--profile <name>`.
  Note: stdio is **fail-open** when `--profile` is omitted (all tools
  visible); profiles are an access boundary on streamable-http only.
- **Fail-closed (streamable-http)** — once profiles exist, an unmatched
  (or ambiguous) identity gets *no* tools unless a permissive `default`
  is set. With no profiles configured, all tools remain visible
  (backward compatible).
- **Single enforcement point** — one filter governs both `tools/list`
  (hiding) and `tools/call` (rejection before the handler runs);
  `tool_search` results are filtered too. Read-only introspection tools
  (`plugin_list`, `tool_stats`, `tool_search`) are always exempt.
- **Anchored tool patterns, exact identity matching** — `allow`/`deny`
  are anchored regexps; identity match values are exact strings.

Validate offline with `wtmcpctl profile check`. Full documentation:
[docs/profiles-guide.md](docs/profiles-guide.md).

## Building and Running

```bash
make build

# Run with a workdir (default: ~/.config/wtmcp)
./wtmcp --workdir ~/.config/wtmcp
```

The workdir layout:

```
~/.config/wtmcp/
  config.yaml           Core config (optional)
  .env                  Environment variables
  env.d/*.env           Additional env files
  profiles.d/*.yaml     Agent profiles (optional; per-agent tool filtering)
  plugins/
    jira/
      plugin.yaml       Plugin manifest
      handler.py        Plugin executable
```

## Writing Plugins

A plugin is a directory with a manifest (`plugin.yaml`) and a handler
executable. The core discovers plugins, starts handlers as child
processes, and routes tool calls over stdin/stdout using JSON-lines.

See [docs/plugin-guide.md](docs/plugin-guide.md) for the full guide
with examples in multiple languages.

### Minimal Example (bash)

A oneshot plugin that runs the handler once per tool call:

**plugin.yaml:**
```yaml
name: hello
version: "1.0.0"
description: "A greeting plugin"
execution: oneshot
handler: ./handler.sh
tools:
  - name: hello_world
    description: "Says hello to someone"
    params:
      name:
        type: string
        default: "World"
        description: "Who to greet"
enabled: true
```

**handler.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -r INPUT
ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.id')
NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.params.name // "World"')

echo "{}" | jq -c --arg id "$ID" --arg name "$NAME" \
  '{id: $id, type: "tool_result", result: {message: ("Hello, " + $name + "!")}}'
```

### API Plugin Example (Python)

A persistent plugin that calls an API through the core's HTTP proxy.
The handler stays running and processes multiple tool calls. Auth
headers are injected automatically — the plugin never sees tokens.

**plugin.yaml:**
```yaml
name: myapi
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Example API plugin"
execution: persistent
handler: ./handler.py

services:
  auth:
    type: bearer
    token: "${MY_API_TOKEN}"
  http:
    base_url: "${MY_API_URL}"

tools:
  - name: myapi_get_status
    description: "Get API status"
    params: {}
  - name: myapi_search
    description: "Search the API"
    params:
      query:
        type: string
        required: true
enabled: true
```

**handler.py:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json, sys

def _send(msg):
    print(json.dumps(msg, separators=(",", ":")), flush=True)

def _recv():
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    if not line:
        sys.exit(0)
    return json.loads(line.strip())

def http(method, path, query=None):
    msg = {"id": "1", "type": "http_request", "method": method, "path": path}
    if query:
        msg["query"] = query
    _send(msg)
    resp = _recv()
    return resp.get("status", 0), resp.get("body", {})

def get_status(_params):
    status, body = http("GET", "/status")
    return body

def search(params):
    status, body = http("GET", "/search", query={"q": params["query"]})
    return body

TOOLS = {"myapi_get_status": get_status, "myapi_search": search}

while True:
    msg = _recv()
    if msg.get("type") == "init":
        _send({"id": msg["id"], "type": "init_ok"})
    elif msg.get("type") == "shutdown":
        _send({"id": msg["id"], "type": "shutdown_ok"})
        break
    elif msg.get("type") == "tool_call":
        fn = TOOLS.get(msg.get("tool"))
        if fn:
            result = fn(msg.get("params", {}))
            _send({"id": msg["id"], "type": "tool_result", "result": result})
        else:
            _send({"id": msg["id"], "type": "tool_result",
                   "error": {"code": "unknown_tool", "message": msg.get("tool")}})
```

### Key Concepts

- **Oneshot** plugins are spawned per tool call. Simplest to write.
- **Persistent** plugins start once and handle many calls via a main loop.
- **HTTP proxy**: plugins send `http_request` messages, the core makes
  the call with auth and returns `http_response`. No HTTP library needed.
- **Cache**: plugins send `cache_get`/`cache_set` messages. The core
  manages storage and TTL.
- **File I/O**: plugins send `file_write`/`file_read` messages. The core
  handles path confinement, atomic writes, and permission enforcement.
- **Auth variants**: a single plugin can support multiple auth methods
  (e.g., Cloud Basic + Server Bearer + Kerberos) with auto-detection.

## Plugin Management

Plugins can be reloaded at runtime without restarting the server.

**From an AI assistant:**
```
plugin_reload(name="jira")
plugin_list()
```

**From a terminal** (control directory):
```bash
touch ~/.config/wtmcp/control/commands/reload-jira
touch ~/.config/wtmcp/control/commands/reload-all
```

Results appear in `~/.config/wtmcp/control/results/`. The server writes
its PID to `~/.config/wtmcp/control/mcp.pid` for process tracking.

MCP clients are automatically notified when tools or resources change.

### OAuth Plugin Management

Plugin authentication (particularly for OAuth-enabled plugins) is managed through the `wtmcpctl` command-line utility. See [docs/wtmcpctl.md](docs/wtmcpctl.md) for usage instructions and setup.

## Encrypted Credentials

env.d files can be encrypted with [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/)
for at-rest protection. The server auto-detects encrypted files by
magic header and decrypts them transparently at startup. Plugins
receive plaintext credentials as usual — no plugin changes needed.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a vault password file (umask prevents brief permission race)
(umask 077 && openssl rand -base64 32 > ~/.vault-pass)

# Tell wtmcp where the password file is
# (add to ~/.config/wtmcp/config.yaml)
#   secrets:
#     vault_password_file: ~/.vault-pass

# Encrypt an env.d file
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file ~/.vault-pass \
    ~/.config/wtmcp/env.d/jira.env

# Start the server — decrypts automatically
wtmcp
```

Encrypted files can be safely committed to git, shared, or backed
up. Anyone who obtains them still needs the vault password to
decrypt.

### Password Sources

The vault password is resolved in priority order:

1. `WTMCP_VAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable (CI/CD convenience)
2. `WTMCP_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` environment variable (path to file)
3. `secrets.vault_password_file` in config.yaml (recommended)

For production and workstations, prefer file-based passwords. Env
vars are intended for CI/CD pipelines where mounting a file is
inconvenient.

### Multi-Password Support (Vault IDs)

Ansible Vault 1.2 supports labeled passwords (vault IDs). Different
env.d files can use different passwords:

```bash
# Encrypt with a vault ID label
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id prod@~/.vault-pass-prod \
    ~/.config/wtmcp/env.d/jira.env
```

Configure per-ID password files in config.yaml:

```yaml
secrets:
  vault_password_file: ~/.vault-pass          # default
  vault_ids:
    prod: ~/.vault-pass-prod
    dev: ~/.vault-pass-dev
```

Per-ID env vars are also supported: `WTMCP_VAULT_PASSWORD_PROD`,
`WTMCP_VAULT_PASSWORD_DEV`.

If no per-ID password is found, the server falls back to the
default password chain automatically.

### Diagnostics

```bash
wtmcp check
```

Reports vault password status and per-group encryption details
(only encrypted groups are shown):

```
vault password: file (~/.vault-pass)
  - jira (encrypted, vault 1.1, decryption ok)
  - snyk (encrypted, vault 1.2 id=prod, decryption failed)
```

### Migrating Existing Files

1. Create a vault password file (see Quick Start)
2. Configure `secrets.vault_password_file` in config.yaml
3. Encrypt one env.d file:
   `ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file ~/.vault-pass env.d/jira.env`
4. Verify: `wtmcp check` should show "decryption ok"
5. Repeat for remaining files
6. Optionally commit encrypted files to git

A single env.d directory can mix plaintext and encrypted files.
Migrate incrementally — one file at a time.

If env.d files were previously committed in plaintext, encrypting
them does not remove the plaintext from git history. Rotate the
affected credentials after migrating and consider using
`git filter-repo` to remove the old plaintext from history.

### Reloading Encrypted Credentials

Credential changes take effect on `plugin_reload` without a server
restart. The vault password is re-read from its source on each
reload, so password rotations are picked up automatically.

### Security Notes

- Ansible Vault uses AES-256-CTR with PBKDF2-SHA256 (10,000
  iterations). Use strong passwords (20+ characters or
  `openssl rand -base64 32`) to compensate for the low iteration
  count.
- **Back up your vault password file.** Losing it means permanent
  loss of access to encrypted credentials. Store a copy in a
  separate secure location.
- Ansible Vault is a practical improvement for development and
  CI/CD. Regulated environments requiring key rotation, audit
  logging, or FIPS-validated crypto should use HashiCorp Vault or
  cloud KMS.

### Credential File Encryption

In addition to env.d files, credential files in
`credentials/<group>/` can also be vault-encrypted. Supported
files:

- `client-credentials.json` (OAuth2 client credentials)
- TLS `client_cert` and `client_key` PEM files

Token files (`token-*.json`) are **not** encrypted — they are
auto-rotated, short-lived, and derived from the client credentials.

Encrypted credential files are decrypted to memory-backed file
descriptors (memfd on Linux, unlinked tmpfile on macOS) so
decrypted content never touches persistent storage. Plugins
receive the same file paths as usual — no plugin changes needed.

### wtmcpctl vault Commands

Encrypt and decrypt files without requiring `ansible-vault`:

```bash
# Encrypt a file
wtmcpctl vault encrypt env.d/jira.env

# Encrypt with vault ID
wtmcpctl vault encrypt --vault-id prod env.d/jira.env

# Decrypt a file
wtmcpctl vault decrypt env.d/jira.env

# Verify decryption without writing
wtmcpctl vault decrypt --check env.d/jira.env

# View decrypted content without modifying the file
wtmcpctl vault view env.d/jira.env
```

Password is sourced from `--vault-password-file`, `WTMCP_VAULT_PASSWORD`
env var, config.yaml, or interactive prompt (with echo suppression).

## Included Plugins

### Google Plugins

Google plugins provide access to Google Workspace services using OAuth2
authentication:

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| google-drive | File metadata, search, and export |
| google-calendar | Calendar events and management |
| google-docs | Document retrieval, summarization, and editing |
| google-gmail | Email reading and sending |

All Google plugins require OAuth2 authentication. See [docs/wtmcpctl.md](docs/wtmcpctl.md)
for setup instructions.

### Jira Plugin

The included Jira plugin covers read, write, sprint, and export
operations:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Read | `jira_search`, `jira_get_myself`, `jira_get_transitions` |
| Write | `jira_create_issue`, `jira_add_comment`, `jira_assign_issue` |
| Sprint | `jira_list_available_sprints`, `jira_get_sprint_issues` |
| Export | `jira_export_sprint_data`, `jira_download_attachment` |

All write tools default to `dry_run=true`. Cloud-aware (ADF format,
accountId assignments). Auth variants: Cloud Basic, Server Bearer,
Server Kerberos.

## Progressive Tool Discovery

By default (`tools.discovery: full`), all tools are loaded into the
model's context. With progressive discovery, only primary tools are
loaded; deferred tools are discoverable via `tool_search`.

Enable in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
tools:
  discovery: progressive
```

Plugin authors mark key tools with `visibility: primary` in
`plugin.yaml`. All other tools default to deferred. See
[docs/plugin-guide.md](docs/plugin-guide.md) for details.

> **Note:** Progressive discovery is a UX optimization — deferred
> tools remain fully registered and callable via the MCP protocol.
> It is not a security boundary. Use `tool_search_exclude_write`
> and elicitation for access control.

## Testing

```bash
# Go tests (requires libarapuca — use make to auto-detect)
make test

# Nosandbox stub tests (no libarapuca needed)
